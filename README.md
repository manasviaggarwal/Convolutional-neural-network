# Convolutional-neural-network

# tipr-third-assignment
This is the third assignment of TIPR-2019. This assignment implements convolution neural network using TensorFlow. Using this CNN we perform two tasks:
1) Design an apparel Identification (Project AI) using Multi-Layer CNN.
2) Design an efficient computer vision system using CNNs that can differentiate between animals and vehicles.
